### Bot Status

#### Customizing Bot Status

First of all we have to add the following piece of code to our main file:

```javascript
client.status({
    name: string,
    type: string,
    time: number,
    URL?: string,
    afk?: boolean
});
```

When you use sharding you can individually change the status of each shard:

```javascript
client.status({
  name: string,
  type: string,
  time: number,
  shard: number,
});
```

---

This will display the text "Example Text!" as bot status, of course you can modify it.

If you want to have multiple statuses just add multiple `client.status({...})` simple do the following:

```javascript title="index.js"
client.status({
  name: "Example Text one!",
  type: "PLAYING",
  time: 12,
});

client.status({
  name: "Example Text two!",
  type: "STREAMING",
  time: 25,
  URL: "some URL",
});

client.status({
  name: "Doing nothing..", // normal status as any other Discord User without any state
  time: 50,
  type: "CUSTOM",
});
```

There are various types of statuses (not case-sensitive):

- **PLAYING**
- **WATCHING**
- **STREAMING**
- **LISTENING**
- **COMPETING**
- **CUSTOM**

### Client Presence

You can also set the bot's presence, by adding the `status` property, for example:

```javascript title="index.js"
client.status({
  name: "Example Text!",
  type: "PLAYING",
  status: "dnd",
  time: 12,
});
```

There are multiple types of presences:

> - **online**
> - **idle**
> - **dnd**
> - **invisible**
